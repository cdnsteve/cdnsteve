### Hi there 👋

I'm Steve, getting back to my roots in hands-on development after years in management. I'm diving deep into AI and building tools that make a difference.

## 🚀 Featured Project: Sugar

I just released [**Sugar**](https://github.com/cdnsteve/sugar) - an open-source tool designed to supercharge developer productivity with AI.

### What is Sugar?
Sugar helps developers integrate AI into their workflow seamlessly, making complex AI tasks simple and intuitive.

📦 **Install it:** `pip install sugarai`  
🔗 **Check it out:** [github.com/cdnsteve/sugar](https://github.com/cdnsteve/sugar)

⭐ If you find it useful, consider giving it a star!
