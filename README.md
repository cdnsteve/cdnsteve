### Hey! 👋

I'm Steve, a developer who loves building cool stuff with AI. After years of mixing code with technical leadership, I'm going all-in on AI tools that actually make developers' lives easier.

## 🚀 Current Project: Sugar 🍰

Just shipped [**Sugar**](https://github.com/cdnsteve/sugar) - an open-source tool for developers who want to use AI without the headache.

### What's Sugar 🍰?
It's the AI tool I wished existed, so I built it. Sugar makes AI integration stupidly simple for developers.

📦 **Grab it:** `pip install sugarai`  
🔗 **Check it out:** [github.com/cdnsteve/sugar](https://github.com/cdnsteve/sugar)

⭐ Stars help others find Sugar (and make my day)

## 🎮 What I'm Up To

- 🤖 Currently: Teaching robots to play nice with developers
- 🧠 Learning: All the AI things (it's a rabbit hole and I love it)
- 🎯 Mission: Making AI less scary, more awesome
- 🤝 Let's collab: Got a wild AI idea? Let's build it!
- 💬 Ask me about: AI, Sugar, or why developers deserve better tools
- 📫 Hit me up: [Drop an issue](https://github.com/cdnsteve/sugar/issues) or start a discussion

*Building cool stuff, breaking things, fixing them, repeat. 🚀*
